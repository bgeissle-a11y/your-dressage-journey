# YDJ Freestyle Test Guardrails
## USDF Dressage Freestyle Rules, Requirements & AI Guidance
### For AI Prompt Context — February 2026

**Companion document to:** YDJ_Level_Progression_Guardrails.md  
**Source:** 2023 USDF Freestyle Rules and Guidelines (effective 12/1/2022–11/30/2026)

## Purpose

This document provides the AI with the specific rules, compulsory elements, forbidden movements, and strategic guidance for USDF dressage freestyles (Training through Fourth Level). It prevents the AI from recommending choreography that includes forbidden movements, suggesting freestyle entry without eligibility, or providing inaccurate guidance about scoring, timing, or artistic impression.

**This document should be included in the prompt context for:**
- Event Planner (all calls, when event type is competition and freestyle is indicated)
- Multi-Voice Coaching (when rider mentions freestyle goals or preparation)
- Grand Prix Thinking Layer 2 (when competition goals include freestyles)

---

## 1. Freestyle Eligibility

### The 63% Rule
A horse/rider combination must have received a **minimum score of 63%** in the highest test of the declared freestyle level (or any test of a higher level) at a USEF-licensed or FEI-recognized competition **prior to** the competition where they enter a freestyle class.

**AI Guardrail Rules:**
- Never recommend entering a freestyle class unless the rider confirms they have a qualifying score of 63%+ at the declared level
- If the rider mentions wanting to ride a freestyle and hasn't mentioned qualifying scores, prompt them to verify eligibility
- The qualifying score must be from a prior competition — scores from the same show do not count
- A score from a HIGHER level also qualifies (e.g., a 63%+ at Second Level qualifies for a Training Level freestyle)

---

## 2. General Freestyle Rules

### Arena & Format
- Performed in a standard dressage arena (20m × 60m)
- No copy of the program is submitted in advance
- The rider is responsible for remembering and executing the choreography
- Current USDF scoresheets must be used

### Time
- **Maximum: 5 minutes** (no minimum time requirement)
- Timing starts when the horse moves forward after the initial halt and salute
- Timing ends at the final halt and salute
- Movements performed after the time limit are NOT scored
- **Penalty:** 1 point deducted from total Artistic Impression for exceeding the time limit (10-second grace period)
- Rider must signal the sound engineer within 45 seconds of the entry bell or face elimination
- Rider must enter the arena within 30 seconds of the music starting
- Exceeding 75 seconds before entering the arena after the bell = elimination

### Music
- Music is mandatory
- Exit music is NOT allowed
- Music must cease at the final halt and salute
- Vocals are permitted
- Entrance music is optional but strongly advised (serves as a sound check)
- Music should ideally be from one genre, style, or theme — mixing genres is not recommended
- Music editing should be fluid and smooth; choppy editing detracts from artistic impression

### Required Salutes
- First and final halt must be on the centerline facing C
- Rider must salute during both halts
- Failure to salute = 2-point error deduction (per occurrence, not cumulative, no elimination)

### Lateral Movement Minimum
- Any lateral movement (shoulder-in, travers, renvers) must cover a minimum distance of **12 meters**
- 18 meters is recommended to clearly establish the rider's intent

## 3. Compulsory Elements by Level

### CRITICAL RULE: All compulsory elements MUST be incorporated into the freestyle program. Omitted elements receive a score of zero (0). Elements required on both hands must be shown in both directions — showing only one direction receives zero for the missing direction.

## 4. FEI Freestyle Tests (Brief Reference)

FEI freestyles (Intermediate I, Intermediate A/B, Grand Prix) are judged according to **FEI rules**, not USDF rules. Key differences:

- FEI freestyle scoresheets and judging criteria differ from USDF
- FEI freestyles have their own compulsory elements based on the corresponding standard test requirements
- FEI Grand Prix Freestyle (Kür) is used for Olympic individual medals
- The AI should reference FEI-specific guidelines when riders mention FEI-level freestyle goals
- The general principles (choreography should showcase the horse, music should match gaits, time limits apply) are similar

**AI Guardrail:** When a rider mentions FEI freestyle goals, the AI should note that FEI freestyles have different requirements and scoring from USDF freestyles, and recommend the rider consult current FEI regulations and their trainer for specific preparation guidance.

---

## 5. Scoring Overview

### Two Score Sets
Freestyles are scored in two separate categories that are totaled separately, then added together and converted to a final percentage.

### Technical Execution
- Each compulsory element receives a score (0–10)
- Elements required on both hands receive separate scores for each direction
- Scores given in **half or full points only** (no tenths)
- **Omitted elements receive 0**
- **Forbidden movements:** 4-point deduction from total Technical Execution per forbidden movement TYPE (not per occurrence)
- All attempts at a compulsory element are considered for the judge's mark

### Artistic Impression
- Scores may be given in **tenths (.1 increments)**
- Categories and their coefficients:

| Category | Training | First | Second | Third | Fourth |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rhythm, Energy & Elasticity | ×4 | ×4 | ×4 | ×4 | ×4 |
| Harmony Between Horse and Rider | ×4 | ×4 | ×4 | ×4 | ×4 |
| Choreography | ×4 | ×4 | ×4 | ×4 | ×4 |
| Degree of Difficulty | ×1 | ×2 | ×3 | ×4 | ×4 |
| Music | ×2 | ×2 | ×2 | ×2 | ×2 |
| Interpretation | ×2 | ×2 | ×2 | ×2 | ×2 |

**Key Observation:** Degree of Difficulty coefficient INCREASES with level, from ×1 at Training to ×4 at Third/Fourth. This means difficulty is weighted much more heavily at upper levels.

### Artistic Impression Category Definitions

**Rhythm, Energy & Elasticity:** Freedom and regularity of gaits plus impulsion — desire to move forward, elasticity of steps, suppleness of back, engagement of hindquarters.

**Harmony Between Horse and Rider:** The partners' positive connection showing rapport, trust, and confidence; a sense of synchrony, contentment, and unity; ability to accomplish choreographic patterns with ease.

**Choreography:** Complete and balanced use of space; logical development and clarity of construction; patterns unlike those of current standard tests at the level shown or below.

**Degree of Difficulty:** Well-calculated risks; the horse/rider team performs a single element or combination of elements in a way that exceeds the expectation of the level.

**Music:** Appropriateness of music to the type and character of horse; selections from one genre, style, or theme; smooth cuts and transitions creating overall flow.

**Interpretation:** Appropriateness of the rhythm and tempo of the music to the gaits of the horse; choreography reflects changes in the music.

### Tiebreaker
Higher total Artistic Impression breaks a tie.

---

## 6. Forbidden Movement Consequences

### The 4-Point Rule
If a rider performs a movement found ONLY in tests above their declared freestyle level, a **4-point deduction** is taken from the total Technical Execution score. This deduction applies per forbidden movement TYPE, not per occurrence (performing the same forbidden movement multiple times only incurs one 4-point deduction).

**AI Guardrail Rules:**
- The AI must NEVER recommend choreography that includes movements from above the declared level unless they are explicitly listed under "Additionally Allowed"
- When reviewing a rider's freestyle plan, the AI should actively check each movement against the compulsory elements, forbidden movements, and additionally allowed lists
- If a rider mentions wanting to include a specific movement in their freestyle, the AI should verify it is permitted at their declared level before encouraging it
- Common mistakes to flag:
  - Training Level: Including leg-yield (this is a First Level movement)
  - First Level: Including shoulder-in or collected gaits (Second Level movements)
  - Second Level: Including flying changes or half-pass (Third Level movements)
  - Third Level: Including tempi changes or pirouettes (Fourth Level movements)

## 7. Strategic Freestyle Guidance for the AI

### USDF Recommendation: Ride One Level Below Schooling Level
The USDF guidelines explicitly state: "To encourage the highest possible technical quality in freestyle performances, competitors are urged to perform freestyles at one level below the level at which they are schooling."

**AI Application:** When a rider mentions freestyle goals, the AI should:
- Acknowledge this recommendation and explain the reasoning (confidence in performance → better artistic impression → higher scores)
- Not mandate it, but present it as a strategic option
- Help the rider evaluate whether they'd score better at their current level or one level below based on their debrief data

### Choreography Strategy Guidance
The AI should advise riders on these principles:

1. **Showcase strengths, minimize weaknesses.** The choreography should be designed around what the horse does well. If the extended trot is a highlight, give it a prominent place. If simple changes are a weak point, don't place them in a visually exposed location.

2. **Use the whole arena.** Choreography that stays on the rail and diagonals will score lower than creative use of space. The AI should encourage use of centerline, quarter lines, and creative patterns.

3. **Don't make it look like a rearranged standard test.** The USDF explicitly states that "a composition that is creative will be scored higher than one that looks like a reworked dressage test set to music."

4. **Degree of Difficulty must be earned.** Points for difficulty are only awarded when the attempt is performed well. The AI should caution against overambitious choreography that overffaces the horse. Better to ride clean and confident than to attempt something impressive and fail.

5. **Music matters more than riders think.** The AI should:
   - Encourage riders to invest in quality music selection and editing
   - Recommend music from a single genre or theme
   - Note that tempo matching to gait rhythms enhances interpretation scores
   - Remind riders that choppy editing detracts from scores
   - Suggest entrance music (strongly recommended per USDF as it provides a sound check)

6. **Additionally Allowed movements can enhance Degree of Difficulty.** These movements can be used strategically to add difficulty points without being forbidden. The AI should highlight which "Additionally Allowed" movements might showcase the rider's horse well.

7. **Time management.** Five minutes seems long but goes fast with all compulsory elements. The AI should help riders think about pacing and ensure all compulsory elements can be completed within the time limit, especially elements required on both hands.

### Multi-Judge Awareness
The AI should remind riders that at championships, multiple judges will be assessing from different positions. Choreography must be clear from all angles, not just from C.

---

## 8. Freestyle Readiness Indicators

The AI should evaluate whether a rider is ready for a freestyle based on these indicators from their debrief and profile data:

### Ready for Freestyle:
- Consistent quality scores at the declared level in standard tests
- 63%+ qualifying score confirmed
- Comfortable with all compulsory movements (no movements consistently flagged as challenges in debriefs)
- Evidence of riding with self-carriage and confidence at the level
- Has or is developing a musical program

### Not Yet Ready:
- Inconsistent quality at the declared level
- No qualifying standard test score
- One or more compulsory elements still being developed
- Debriefs show frequent challenges with movements that are compulsory at the freestyle level
- No music program in development

### Consider Riding Freestyle One Level Below:
- Has qualifying score at declared level but scores are in the 60–65% range
- Some compulsory movements are inconsistent
- Would benefit from the confidence boost of riding at a level where everything is well-confirmed
- Wants to maximize artistic impression scores through ease and harmony

---

## 9. Freestyle in the Context of Level Progression

### Integration with Level Progression Guardrails
Freestyle adds a creative dimension to standard test progression but should not be confused with advancing to the next level. Key principles:

- **Freestyle readiness ≠ readiness to move up a level.** A rider may be ready to compete a freestyle at their current level but not ready to move up. Freestyle focuses on quality and presentation AT the current level.
- **Freestyle can be a confidence builder.** Riding a freestyle at or below current level, set to music the rider enjoys, can reinforce confidence and partnership — valuable goals independent of level progression.
- **Freestyle preparation develops choreographic thinking.** Understanding arena geometry, transitions, and how to showcase movements builds rider education that serves them at all levels.
- **The 63% threshold is a readiness signal.** If the rider has scored 63%+ in the highest standard test at their level, they have demonstrated sufficient proficiency for freestyle. Below 63%, the AI should recommend focusing on standard test quality first.

### AI Rules for Freestyle + Progression:
- Never suggest a rider enter a freestyle at a level where they haven't scored 63%+ in a standard test
- Never suggest a freestyle as a substitute for standard test competition when evaluating readiness to move up
- When a rider is between levels, a freestyle at the confirmed lower level can be a meaningful competitive goal while continuing to develop the next level in training
- Freestyles at "Additionally Allowed" difficulty levels do NOT count as competing at the higher level — they are still the declared level
